# Tutorial

We are currently establishing a series of benchmarks to ensure the integrity of the code during new development and implementation campaigns. These benchmarks not only aim at testing each module's functionalities but also at introducing the code to new users. There intend to be performed on a maximum of 8 cores and on a running time inferior to one hour.
